# Continuous delivery

- objective is to get around the **OODA** loop (Observe – Orient - Decide – Act) faster
- teams should be organised around microservices with a separate platform team exposing an API that all other teams use
- DevOps should be a reorganization of teams, contrary to the tendency that companies are organized in teams, product managers, developers, QA, etc., and getting something done requires a lot of meetings, a kind of waterfall approach that takes too long.
- end-to-end process of developing and releasing software is often long and cumbersome, it involves many people, departments and obstacles

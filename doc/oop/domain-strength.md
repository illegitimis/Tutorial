## services

Services are **first-class citizens** of the domain model. When concepts of the model would _distort_ any `Entity` or `Value Object`, a `Service` is _appropriate_.

A good Service has these characteristics:
+ The operation relates to a domain concept that is _not a natural part_ of an Entity or Value Object
+ The interface is defined _in terms of_ other elements in the domain model
+ The operation is **stateless**

Services are _always exposed as an interface_, not for “swappability”, testability or the like, but to **expose a set of cohesive operations in the form of a contract**. On a sidenote, it always bothered me when people say that an interface with one implementation is a design smell. No, an interface is used to expose a contract. Interfaces communicate design intent, far better than a class might.

But most examples I see of Services are something trivial, such as `IEmailSender`. But Services exist in most layers of the DDD layered architecture: _Application_, _Domain_, _Infrastructure_.

An _Infrastructure Service_ would be something like our `IEmailSender`, that _communicates directly with external resources_, such as the file system, registry, SMTP, database, etc.  Something like NHibernate would show up in the Infrastructure.

_Domain services_ are the **coordinators**, allowing higher level functionality between many different smaller parts.  These would include things like `OrderProcessor`, `ProductFinder`, `FundsTransferService`, and so on. Since Domain Services are first-class citizens of our domain model, their names and usages should be part of the Ubiquitous Language. _Meanings and responsibilities_ **should make sense** to the stakeholders or domain experts.

In many cases, the software we write is replacing or supplementing a human’s job, such as _Order Processor_, so it’s often we find inspiration in the existing business process for names and responsibilities. Where an existing name doesn’t fit, we dive into the domain to try and surface a hidden concept with the domain expert, which might have existed but didn’t have a name.

Finally, we have _Application Services_. In many cases, Application Services are the **interface used by the outside world**, where the outside world can’t communicate via our Entity objects, but may have other representations of them. Application Services could map outside messages to internal operations and processes, communicating with services in the Domain and Infrastructure layers to provide cohesive operations for outside clients. Messaging patterns tend to rule Application Services, as the other service layers don’t have a reference back out to the Application Services. _Business rules are not allowed in an Application Service_, those belong in the Domain layer.

In top-down design, we typically start from the Application or Domain Service, defining the actual interface clients use, then use TDD to drive out the implementation. As we’re always starting from the client perspective with actual client scenarios, we get a high degree of confidence that what we’re building will create success and add value.  When stories are vertical slices of functionality, this is fairly straightforward, at least mechanically so.

I used to make the mistake of dismissing Services as a necessary evil, I’ve started to realize the potential the Application and Domain services have in creating a well-designed model.

## primer
### Code smells
A lot of DDD is just plain good OO programming. Unit tests and code smells are the best indication that our domain is wrong, along with conversations with our domain experts. In systems that start to move beyond merely CRUD, _specific code smells start to surface that should indicate that our system is starting to accumulate behavior_, but it just might not be in the right place. In a behavior-rich, but anemic domain, the domain is surrounded by a multitude of services that do the actual work, and fiddle with state on our domain objects. The domain objects _contain state to be persisted_, but it’s _not the domain objects themselves exposing any operations_. But this is just code smell! Lots of code smells indicate that our domain is not as rich as at could be. The behavior is out there, but just needs to be moved around. Some smells I look for include:
+ Primitive Obsession
+ Data Class
+ Inappropriate Intimacy
+ Lazy Class
+ Feature Envy
+ Middle Man

All these are smells between classes, where usually a domain service is waaaay to concerned with a set of entities, when behavior could just be moved down into those entities.

### Aggregate Roots
One of the most quoted, but most misunderstood ideas in DDD is the concept of `aggregate roots`. But what is this aggregate root? Is it just an entity with a screen in front of it? A row in a database? Evans defined a set of rules for Aggregates:
+ The root Entity has **global identity** and is _ultimately responsible for checking invariants_
+ Entities inside the boundary have _local identity_, **unique only within the Aggregate**.
+ _Nothing outside_ the Aggregate boundary can hold a reference to anything inside, except to the root Entity. The root Entity _can hand references to the internal Entities_ to other objects, but they can only use them **transiently** (within a single method or block).
+ Only Aggregate Roots can be obtained _directly_ with database queries. Everything else must be done through **traversal**.
+ Objects within the Aggregate _can hold references_ to other Aggregate roots.
+ A _delete_ operation **must remove everything within the Aggregate boundary all at once**
+ When a _change_ to any object within the Aggregate boundary is _committed_, _all invariants of the whole Aggregate must be satisfied_.
+ It’s a lot, but I generally think of Aggregate roots as consistency boundaries. **When I interact with an Aggregate, its invariants must always be satisfied**. Keeping invariants satisfied strengthens the design and responsibility of the objects, as the logic that defines the Aggregate is then self-contained.

### Strategic Design
We may not like it, but not all of our system’s model will ever reach our vision of perfection. Which is fine, as a perfect model across our entire system would be _prohibitively expensive_ with little ROI on all that work.  Instead, we have to focus on specific areas of the core domain that provide the most value to the customer. The better our core domain model, the better our system represents the conceptual model we’ve defined with our customers, and the better we will be able to serve their needs.

Unfortunately, all the interesting _Strategic Design_ chapters are after the basic DDD patterns in the book, so that many folks get lost discussing repositories, entities, aggregates and so on. But in recent interviews, Evans mentions that these later discussions are more important than the earlier ones. The bottom line is that we have to choose carefully where we spend our time refining our domain model. Some areas will not be as refined as others, but that’s perfectly acceptable. The trick is to find which areas will give us the most value for our time spent in refactoring, refinement and modeling.
Finally, it’s worth noting that there is no “best” design. There is only the **best design given our current understanding**. _Software development is a process of discovery_, where concepts that seemed unimportant or hidden may suddenly become obvious and critical later. That’s still normal, and not a negative thing. Lots of concepts around an idea will be thrown around, but only the most important ones will rise to the top, and sometimes that just takes time.

## Aggregate Construction

Our application complexity has hit its tipping point, and we decide to move past [anemic domain models](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html) to rich, behavioral models.  But what is this anemic domain model?  Let's look at Fowler's definition, now over 6 years old:

> The basic symptom of an Anemic Domain Model is that at first blush it looks like the real thing. There are objects, many named after the nouns in the domain space, and these objects are connected with the rich relationships and structure that true domain models have. The catch comes when you look at the behavior, and you realize that there is hardly any behavior on these objects, making them little more than bags of getters and setters. Indeed often these models come with design rules that say that you are not to put any domain logic in the the domain objects. Instead there are a set of service objects which capture all the domain logic. These services live on top of the domain model and use the domain model for data.

For CRUD applications, these "domain services" should number very few.  But as the number of domain services begins to grow, it should be a signal to us that we need richer behavior, in the form of Domain-Driven Design.  Building an application with DDD in mind is quite different than [Model-Driven Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture). In MDA, we start with database table diagrams or ERDs, and build objects to match.  In DDD, we start with interactions and behaviors, and build models to match.  But one of the first issues we run into is, how do we create entities in the first place?  Our first unit test needs to create an entity, so where should it come from?

### Creating Valid Aggregates

Validation can be a tricky beast in applications, as we often see validation has less to do with _data_ than it does with _commands_.  For example, a Person might have a required "BirthDate" field on a screen.  But we then have the requirement that legacy, imported Persons might not have a BirthDate.  So it then becomes clear that the requirement of a BirthDate depends on who is doing the creation.

But beyond validation are the invariants of an entity. **Invariants are the essence of what it means for an entity to be an entity**. We may ask our customers, can a Person be a Person (in our system) without a BirthDate? Yes, sometimes. How about without a Name? No, a Person in our system must have some identifying features, that together define this "Person".  An Order needs an OrderNumber and a Customer. If the business got a paper order form without customer information, they'd throw it out! Notice this is not _validation_, but something else entirely. We're asking now, what does it mean for an Order to be an Order? Those are its invariants.

Suppose then we have a rather simple set of logic.  We indicate our Orders as "local" if the billing province is equal to the customer's province. Rather easy method:

```cs
public class Order
{
    public bool IsLocal()
    {
        return Customer.Province == BillingProvince;
    }
```

I simply interrogate the Customer's province against the Order's BillingProvince. But now I can get myself into rather odd situations:

```cs
[Test]
public void Should_be_a_local_customer_when_provinces_are_equal()
{
    var order = new Order
    {
       BillingProvince = "Ontario"
    };
    var customer = new Customer
    {
        Province = "Ontario"
    };

    var isLocal = order.IsLocal();

    isLocal.ShouldBeTrue();
}
```

Instead of a normal assertion pass/fail, I get a NullReferenceException! I forgot to set the Customer on the Order object.

But wait – how was I able to create an Order without a Customer?  An Order isn't an Order without a Customer, as our domain experts explained to us. _We could go the slightly ridiculous route, and put in null checks_.

But wait – this will _never_ happen in production. We should just fix our test code and move on, right?  Yes, I'd agree if you were building a transaction-script based CRUD system (the 90% case).  However, if we're doing DDD, we want to satisfy that requirement about aggregate roots, that its invariants must be satisfied with all operation.  _Creating an aggregate root is an operation_, and therefore in our code "new" is an operation.  Right now, invariants are decidedly _not_ satisfied.

Let's modify our Order class slightly:

```cs
public class Order
{
    public Order(Customer customer)
    {
        Customer = customer;
    }
```

We added a constructor to our Order class, so that when an Order is created, all invariants are satisfied.  Our test now needs to be modified with our new invariant in place:

```cs
[TestFixture]
public class Invariants
{
    [Test]
    public void Should_be_a_local_customer_when_provinces_are_equal()
    {
        var customer = new Customer
        {
            Province = "Ontario"
        };
        var order = new Order(customer)
        {
            BillingProvince = "Ontario"
        };

        var isLocal = order.IsLocal();

        isLocal.ShouldBeTrue();
    }
}
```

And now our test passes!

### Summary and alternatives

Going from a data-driven approach, this will cause pain. If we write our persistence tests first, we run into "why do I need a Customer just to test Order persistence?" Or, why do we need a `Customer` to test order totalling logic? The problem occurs further down the line when you start writing code against a domain model that doesn't enforce its own invariants. _If invariants are only satisfied through domain services, it becomes quite tricky to understand_ what a true `Order` is at any time. Should we always code assuming the Customer is there? Should we code it only when we "need" it?

If our entity always satisfies its invariants because its design doesn't allow invariants to be violated, the violated invariants can never occur.  We no longer need to even _think_ about the possibility of a missing Customer, and can build our software under that enforced rule going forward. In practice, I've found this approach actually requires _less_ code, as we don't allow ourselves to get into ridiculous scenarios that we now have to think about going forward.

But building entities through a constructor isn't the only way to go. We also have:

* [Builder pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ExpressionBuilder.html)
* [Creation method](http://www.industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/constructorCreation.html)
* [Through existing aggregate roots](http://www.udidahan.com/2009/06/29/dont-create-aggregate-roots/)

The bottom line is – if our entity needs certain information for it to be considered an entity in its essence, then don't let it be created without its invariants satisfied!

## Encapsulated collections

One of the common themes throughout the [DDD book](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) is that much of the nuts and bolts of structural domain-driven design is just plain good use of object-oriented programming.  This is certainly true, but DDD adds some direction to OOP, along with roles, stereotypes and patterns. _Much of the direction for building entities at the class level can, and should, come from test-driven development_. TDD is a great tool for building OO systems, as we incrementally build our design with only the behavior that is needed to pass the test. Our big challenge then is to write good tests.

To fully harness TDD, we need to be highly attuned to the design that comes out of our tests. For example, suppose we have our traditional Customer and Order objects. In our world, an `Order` has a `Customer`, and a `Customer` can have many `Orders`.  We have this directionality because we can navigate this relationship from both directions in our application. In the last post, we worked to satisfy invariants to prevent an unsupported and nonsensical state for our objects.

We can start with a fairly simple test:

```cs
[Test]
public void Should_add_the_order_to_the_customers_order_lists_when_an_order_is_created()
{
    var customer = new Customer();
    var order = new Order(customer);

    customer.Orders.ShouldContain(order);
}
```

At first, this test does not compile, as Customer does not yet contain an Orders member.
To make this test compile (and subsequently fail), we add an Orders list to Customer:

```cs
public class Customer
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public List<Order> Orders { get; set; }

    public string GetFullName()
    {
        return LastName + ", " + FirstName;
    }
}
```

With the Orders now exposed on Customer, we can make our test pass from the Order constructor:

```cs
public class Order
{
    public Order(Customer customer)
    {
        Customer = customer;
        customer.Orders.Add(this);
    }
```

And all is well in our development world, right? Not quite. This design exposes quite a bit of functionality that I don't think our domain experts need, or want. The design above allows some very interesting and very wrong scenarios:

```cs
[Test]
public void Not_supported_situations()
{
    // Removing orders?
    var customer1 = new Customer();
    var order1 = new Order(customer1);

    customer1.Orders.Remove(order1);

    // Clearing orders?
    var customer2 = new Customer();
    var order2 = new Order(customer1);

    customer2.Orders.Clear();

    // Duplicate orders?
    var customer3 = new Customer();
    var customer4 = new Customer();
    var order3 = new Order(customer3);

    customer4.Orders.Add(order3);
}
```

With the API I just created, I allow a number of rather bizarre scenarios, most of which make absolutely no sense to the domain experts:

* Clearing orders
* Removing orders
* Adding an order from one customer to another
* Inserting orders
* Re-arranging orders
* Adding an order without the Order's Customer property being correct

This is where we have to be a little more judicious in the API we expose for our system. All of these scenarios are _possible_ in the API we created, but now we have some confusion on whether we should support these scenarios or not. If I'm working in a similar area of the system, and I see that I can do a `Customer.Orders.Remove` operation, it's not immediately clear that this is a scenario not actually coded for.  Worse, I don't have the ability to correctly handle these situations if the collection is exposed directly.

Suppose I want to clear a Customer's Orders. It logically follows that each Order's Customer property would be null at that point. But I can't hook in easily to the `List`

### Moving towards intention-revealing interfaces

Let's fix the Customer object first. It exposes a List

```cs
public class Customer
{
    private readonly IList<Order> _orders = new List<Order>();

    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<Order> Orders { get { return _orders; } }

    public string GetFullName()
    {
        return LastName + ", " + FirstName;
    }
}
```

This interface explicitly tells users of Customer two things:

* Orders are **readonly**, and cannot be modified through this aggregate
* Adding orders are done somewhere else

I now have the issue of the Order constructor needing to add itself to the Customer's Order collection. I want to do this:

```cs
public class Order
{
    public Order(Customer customer)
    {
        Customer = customer;
        customer.AddOrder(this);
    }
```

Instead of exposing the Orders collection directly, I work through a specific method to add an order. But, I don't want that AddOrder available everywhere, I want to only support the enforcement of the Order-Customer relationship through this explicitly defined interface. I'll do this by exposing an AddOrder method, but exposing it as internal:

```cs
public class Customer
{
    private readonly IList<Order> _orders = new List<Order>();

    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<Order> Orders { get { return _orders; } }

    internal void AddOrder(Order order)
    {
        _orders.Add(order);
    } 
}
```

There are many different ways I could enforce this relationship, from exposing an AddOrder method publicly on Customer or through the approach above. But either way, I'm moving towards an **intention-revealing interface**, and only exposing the operations I intend to support through my application.  Additionally, I'm ensuring that all invariants of my aggregates are satisfied at the completion of the Create Order operation. _When I create an Order, the domain model takes care of the relationship between Customer and Order without any additional manipulation_.

_If I publicly expose a collection class_, I'm opening the doors for confusion and future bugs as I've now allowed my system to tinker with the implementation details of the relationship. It's my belief that the API of my domain model should explicitly support the operations needed to fulfill the needs of the application and interaction of the UI, but nothing more.

## Encapsulating operations

In previous posts, we walked through the journey from an intentionally anemic domain model (one specifically designed with CRUD in mind), towards a design of a stronger domain model design. Many of the comments on twitter and in the posts noted that many of the design techniques are just plain good OO design. Yes! That's the idea.  If we have behavior in our system, it might not be in the right place. The DDD domain design techniques are in place to _help move_ that _behavior from services surrounding the domain_ back into the domain model where it belongs.

Besides managing the creation of aggregates and relationships inside and between aggregate roots, there comes the point where we need to actually..._update information in our domain model_.  One of the _tipping points_ from moving from a CRUD model to a DDD model is **emergent complexity in updating information in our model**.

### Fees and Payments

Let's suppose that in our domain we can levy `Fees` against `Customers`. Later, `Customers` can _make_ `Payments` on those `Fees`.  At any time, I can _look up_ a `Fee` and _determine_ the Fee's **balance**.  Or, I can look up all the Customer's Fees, and see a list of all the Fee's balances. Based on the previous posts, I might end up with something like this:

```cs
[Test]
public void Should_apply_the_fee_to_the_customer_when_charging_a_customer_a_fee()
{
    var customer = new Customer();
    var fee = customer.ChargeFee(100m);
    fee.Amount.ShouldEqual(100m);
    customer.Fees.ShouldContain(fee);
}
```

The ChargeFee method is rather straightforward:

```cs
public Fee ChargeFee(decimal amount)
{
    var fee = new Fee(amount, this);
    _fees.Add(fee);
    return fee;
}
```

Next, we want to be able to _apply a payment_ to a fee:

```cs
[Test]
public void Should_be_able_to_record_a_payment_against_a_fee()
{
    var customer = new Customer();
    var fee = customer.ChargeFee(100m);
    var payment = fee.AddPayment(25m);
    fee.RecalculateBalance();
    payment.Amount.ShouldEqual(25m);
    fee.Balance.ShouldEqual(75m);
}
```

We _store_ a **calculated balance**, as this gives us much _better performance_, _querying abilities_ and so on.  It's rather easy to make this test pass:

```cs
public Payment AddPayment(decimal paymentAmount)
{
    var payment = new Payment(paymentAmount, this);
    _payments.Add(payment);
    return payment;
}

public void RecalculateBalance()
{
    var totalApplied = _payments.Sum(payment => payment.Amount);
    Balance = Amount - totalApplied;
}
```

However, our test looks rather strange at this point. We have a method to _establish the relationship_ between `Fee` and `Payment` (the `AddPayment` method), which acts as a _simple facade over the internal list_.  But what's with that extra `RecalculateBalance` method?  In many codebases, that 'RecalculateBalance' method would be in a `BalanceCalculationService`, reinforcing an anemic domain.

But we can do one better. Isn't the act of recording a payment a complete operation?  **In the real physical world, when I give a person money, the entire transaction is completed as a whole**.  Either it all completes successfully, or the transaction is invalid.  In our example, how can I add a payment and the balance _not_ be immediately updated?  It's rather confusing to have to "remember" to use these extra calculation services and helper methods, just because our domain objects are too dumb to handle it themselves.

### Thinking with commands

When we called the `AddPayment` method, we _left_ our `Fee` aggregate root _in an in-between state_. **It had a Payment, yet its balance was incorrect**. If Fees are supposed to act as _consistency boundaries_, we've violated that consistency with this invalid state.  Looking strictly through a code smell standpoint, this is the [Inappropriate Intimacy](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InappropriateIntimacy) code smell.  **Inappropriate Intimacy is one of the biggest indicators of an anemic domain model**.  The behavior is there, but just in the wrong place.

But we can help ourselves to enforce those aggregate boundaries with **encapsulation**.  Not just encapsulation like properties encapsulate fields, but **encapsulating the operation** of recording a fee.  Even the name of `AddPayment` could be improved, to `RecordPayment`.  The act of recording a payment in the Real World involves _adding the payment to the ledger_ and _updating the balance book_.  If the accountant solely adds the payment to the ledger, but does not update the balance book, they haven't yet finished recording the payment.  Why don't we do the same?  Here's our modified test:

```cs
[Test]
public void Should_be_able_to_record_a_payment_against_a_fee()
{
    var customer = new Customer();
    var fee = customer.ChargeFee(100m);
    var payment = fee.RecordPayment(25m);
    payment.Amount.ShouldEqual(25m);
    fee.Balance.ShouldEqual(75m);
}
```

We _got rid of_ that pesky, strange extra `Recalculate` call, and now _encapsulated the entire command of "Record this payment" to our aggregate root_, the `Fee` object.  The `RecordPayment` method now encapsulates the complete operation of recording a payment, ensuring that _the `Fee` root is self-consistent_ at the completion of the operation:

```cs
public Payment RecordPayment(decimal paymentAmount)
{
    var payment = new Payment(paymentAmount, this);
    _payments.Add(payment);
    RecalculateBalance();
    return payment;
}

private void RecalculateBalance()
{
    var totalApplied = _payments.Sum(payment => payment.Amount);
    Balance = Amount - totalApplied;
}
```

Notice that we've also made the Recalculate method _private_, as this is an _implementation detail_ of how the Fee object keeps the balance consistent.  From someone using the `Fee` object, **we don't care how the Fee object keeps itself consistent**, we only want to care that it is consistent.

The public contour of the Fee object is simplified as well.  We only _expose operations that we want to support_, captured in the names of our ubiquitous language.  The "How" is encapsulated behind the aggregate root boundary.

### Wrapping it up

We again see that a consistent theme in DDD is good OO and attention to code smells. DDD helps us by giving us patterns and direction, towards placing more and more logic inside our domain.  The difference between an intentionally anemic domain model (a [persistence model](https://lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/archive/2009/12/03/persistence-model-and-domain-anemia.aspx)) and an anemic domain model is the presence of these code smells.  If you don't have a legion of supporting services propping up the state of your domain model, then there's no problem.

However, it's these external domain services where we are likely to find the bulk of domain model smells.  Through attention to the code smells and refactorings [Fowler laid out](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672), we can move towards the concepts of **self-consistent aggregate roots with strongly-enforced boundaries**.

## The double dispatch pattern
It looks like there's a pattern emerging here around encapsulation, and **that's not an accident**. Many of the code smells in the Fowler or Kerievsky refactoring books deal with proper encapsulation of both data _and_ behavior. In the previous post, we looked at _closure of operations_, that _when an operation is completed_, the **aggregate root's state is consistent**.

In many anemic domain models, **the behavior is there but in the wrong place**. For the DDD-literate, this is usually in a lot of domain services all poking at the state of the domain model. We can refactor these services to _enforce consistency_ through closed operations on our model, but there are cases where this sort of domain behavior _doesn't_ belong in the model.

This now begins to be difficult to reconcile. We want to have a consistent model, but now we want to bring in services to the mix. Do we now forgo the concept of **Command/Query Separation** in our model, and just expose state? Or can we have our cake and eat it too?

### Bringing in services

The last example looked at fees, payments and customers.  When a payment is recorded against a fee, we re-calculate the balance:

```cs
public Payment RecordPayment(decimal paymentAmount)
{
    var payment = new Payment(paymentAmount, this);
    _payments.Add(payment);
    RecalculateBalance();
    return payment;
}

private void RecalculateBalance()
{
    var totalApplied = _payments.Sum(payment => payment.Amount);
    Balance = Amount - totalApplied;
}
```

The problem comes in when calculating the balance becomes more difficult.  We might have a rather complex method for calculating payments, we might have _recurring payments, transfers, debits, credits_ and so on.  This might become **too much responsibility** for the `Fee` object. In fact, it could be argues that the Fee shouldn't be responsible for _how_ the balance is calculated, but instead only _ensure that when a payment is recorded, the balance is updated_.

We have several options here:

* _Update_ the Balance **outside** the `RecordPayment` method, with the caller "remembering"
* Use a `BalanceCalculator` service _as part of_ the `RecordPayment` method

**I never like a solution that requires a user of the domain to "remember" to call a method after another one**.  It's not intention-revealing, and tends to leave the domain model in a wacky _in-between state_. For many domains, this might be acceptable. But with more complexity comes the issue of trying to sort out what scenarios are valid or not. When a test breaks because an invariant is not satisfied, that's a clear message that something broke the domain.

But if we leave our domain in half-baked states, it becomes much more difficult to decipher what to do when we change the behavior of our model and tests start to break. Are the existing scenarios supported, or are they just around?  In the case of the latter, that's where you start to see more defensive coding practices, throwing exceptions, gut-check asserts and so on.

So we decide to go with the _Aggregate Root relying on a Domain Service for balance calculation_. Now we have to decide _where_ the service comes from.

For those using a DI container, you might try to inject the dependencies into the aggregate root. That leads to a whole host of problems, which are so numerous I won't derail a perfectly good post by getting into it. Instead, there's another, more intention-revealing option: the double dispatch pattern.

### Services and the double dispatch pattern

The double dispatch pattern is quite simple.  It involves _passing an object to a method_, and the method body _calls another method on the passed in object_, usually _passing in itself as an argument_.  In our case, we'll first create an interface that represents our balance calculator domain service:

```cs
public interface IBalanceCalculator
{
    decimal Calculate(Fee fee);
}
```

The signature of the method is important. It accepts a Fee object, but returns the total directly. _It doesn't try to modify the Fee_, allowing for a **side-effect free function**. I can call the calculator as many times as I like with a given Fee, and **I can be assured that the Fee object won't be changed**.  From the Fee side, I now need to use this service as part of recording a payment:

```cs
public Payment RecordPayment(decimal paymentAmount, IBalanceCalculator balanceCalculator)
{
    var payment = new Payment(paymentAmount, this);
    _payments.Add(payment);
    Balance = balanceCalculator.Calculate(this);
    return payment;
}
```

The intent of the `RecordPayment` method remains the same: it records a payment, and updates the balance. The balance on the Fee object will always be correct.  The wrinkle we added is that our RecordPayment method now delegates to a domain service, the IBalanceCalculator, for calculation of the balance. However, **the Fee object is still responsible for maintaining a correct balance**. We just call the Calculate method on the balance calculator, passing in "this", to figure out what the actual correct balance can be.

### Wrapping it up

When a domain object begins to contain _too many_ responsibilities, we start to break out those extra responsibilities into things like value objects and domain services.  This does not mean we have to give up consistency and closure of operations, however.  **With the use of the double dispatch pattern, we can avoid anemic domain models**, as well as the _forlorn attempt to inject services into our domain model_. Our methods stay very intention-revealing, showing exactly what is needed to fulfill a request of recording a payment.

## No silver domain modeling bullets

This past week, I attended a presentation on **Object-Role Modeling** (with the unfortunate acronym ORM) and its application to DDD modeling. The talk itself was interesting, but more interesting were some of the questions from the audience. The gist of the tool is to provide a better modeling tool for domain modeling than traditional ERM tools or UML class diagrams. ORM is a tool for _fact-based analysis of informational models_, information being _data plus semantics_. I’m not an ORM expert, but there are plenty of resources on the web.
One of the outputs of this tool could be a complete database, with all constraints, relationships, tables, columns and whatnot built and enforced. However, the speaker, Josh Arnold, mentioned repeatedly that it was not a good idea to do so, or at least it doesn’t scale at all. It could be used as a starting point, but that’s about it.

Several times at the end of the talk, the question came up, “can I use this to generate my domain model” or “database”. Tool-generated applications are a lofty, but extremely flawed goal. Code generation is interesting as a one-time, one-way affair. But beyond that, code generation does not work. We’ve seen it time and time again.  Even though the tools get better, the underlying invalid assumption does not change. The fundamental problem is that _visual code design tools can never and will never be as expressive, flexible and powerful as actual code_.  There will always be a mismatch here, and it is a fool’s errand to try to build anything more. Instead, the ORM tool looked quite useful as a modeling tool for generating conversation and validating assumptions about their domain, rather than a domain model builder.

Ultimately, the only validation that our domain is correct is the working code. There is no silver bullet for writing code, as there is always some level of complexity in our applications that requires customization. And there’s nothing that codegen tools hate more than modification of the generated code  However, I’m open to the idea that I’m wrong here, and I would love to be shown otherwise.

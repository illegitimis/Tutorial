# Events

- Delegates provide the basic _callback mechanism_ required for _notifications_
- Should the delegate be passed as a method argument, a constructor argument, or perhaps as a property?
- How should you support _unsubscribing_ from notifications?
- From the outside, the only things you can do to an event are to attach a handler using `+=` and to remove one using `-=`

# Immutable

- _immutable_, meaning that it **sets all of its fields during initialization** and then never modifies them again. compiler will generate an error if you attempt to modify that field from outside of a constructor.
- `ToLookup` converts an `IEnumerable<T>` to a `Lookup<Key, Element>` type. `Lookup` is like a dictionary, but where a `Dictionary` uses a single key value, Lookup maps keys to a collection of values. Lookups have no public constructor and are _immutable_. You cannot add or remove elements or keys after they are created.
- Since **value types should normally be immutable**, a requirement for mutability is usually a _good sign that you want a class rather than a struct_
- `readonly` protects the location of the field from being changed outside the typeâ€™s constructor, but does not protect the value at that location.
- Immutable types **do not have any publicly exposed setters**, such as `int`, `double`, or `String`.

```cs
//compile error
string s = "Hello"; s[0] = 'c';
```

- All simple types are immutable. Any structs you create should also be immutable.
- ERIC LIPPERT 
> This is yet another reason why value types should be immutable: If a change is impossible, then the fact that changes made to an `unboxed struct` are not reflected in the `boxed struct` becomes irrelevant. Rather than dealing with the unexpected and confusing semantics, avoid them altogether.

- The `Regex` class is the heart of the FCL regular expression support. Used both as an object instance and a static type, the `Regex` class represents an immutable, _compiled instance of a regular expression_ that can be applied to a string via a matching process. Internally, the regular expression is stored as either a _sequence of internal regular expression bytecodes_ that are **interpreted at match time** or as **compiled MSIL opcodes** that are **JIT-compiled by the CLR at runtime**. This allows you to make a tradeoff between worsened regular expression startup time and memory utilization versus _h_igher raw match performance at runtime_.

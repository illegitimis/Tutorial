# cap theorem

> Computer science [theorem][3] that quantifies the _inevitable trade-offs_. [Eric Brewerâ€™s CAP theorem][4] says that if you want _CAP_ you have to settle for two out of three.

acronym | title | description
---|---|---
**C** | consistency/sequential consistency | _All_ the replicas are in _sync_ and maintain the _same state_ of _any given object_ at **any given point of time**.
**A** | availability | A request will _eventually_ complete _successfully_. A read/write request on any node of the system will never be rejected as long as the particular node is up and running.
**P** | partition tolerance | (distributed system) [will continue to work unless there is a total network failure](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/07/06/brewer-cap-theorem-base/). A few nodes can fail and the system keeps going. When the network connecting the nodes goes down, the system will still continue to operate even though some/all nodes can NO longer communicate with each other.

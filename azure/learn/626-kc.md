Recall that the Tailwind Traders' Special Orders application includes two virtual machines, Azure Load Balancer, and Azure SQL Database:

![A diagram showing two virtual machines connected to Azure Load Balancer and Azure SQL Database.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/choose-azure-services-sla-lifecycle/media/4-special-orders-architecture.svg)

Here's the service-level agreement (SLA) for each service:

Service	| SLA (percent)
---|---
Azure Virtual Machines x2 | 99.9 
Azure SQL Database|99.99
Azure Load Balancer|99.99

To compute the composite SLA for a set of services, you multiply the SLA of each individual service. \
Recall that the existing composite SLA is: \
99.9% × 99.9% × 99.99% × 99.99% = 99.78%

The team wants to add a mapping feature so that it can calculate routes between nearby suppliers and each retail store. \
For that, the team will use Azure Maps.

The team also needs more processing power to keep up with demand. \
For that, it will add a third virtual machine to the pool.

Here's a diagram that shows their proposed plan:

Recall that you can access SLAs from [Service Level Agreements](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/).

## Check your knowledge

1. What's the SLA for Azure Maps in terms of guaranteed uptime?

- [ ] 99 percent
- [X] 99.9 percent \
Correct. The [SLA for Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/azure-maps?azure-portal=true) tells you the SLA.
- [ ] 99.99 percent

2. What's the new composite SLA? Remember, the new SLA includes a third virtual machine and Azure Maps.
- [X] 99.58 percent \
Correct. To compute the composite SLA for a set of services, you multiply the SLA of each individual service.
- [ ] 99.78 percent
- [ ] 99.99 percent

3. Adding a third virtual machine reduces the composite SLA. How can Tailwind Traders offset this reduction?

- [ ] Increase the size of each virtual machine.
- [X] Deploy extra instances of the same virtual machines across the different availability zones in the same Azure region. \
Correct. If one availability zone is affected, your virtual machine instance in the other availability zone should be unaffected.
- [ ] Do nothing. Using Azure Load Balancer increases the SLA for virtual machines.

4. What approach might the company take in adding the augmented reality (AR) preview service to its architecture?

- [ ] The Special Orders app is already in production. The company shouldn't look into the AR service until the service reaches general availability (GA).
- [ ] The Special Orders app is mainly for use by retail employees. \
The company can integrate the AR service now because potential downtime or failures aren't an important factor.
- [X] The development team can create a prototype version of the app that includes the AR service that it tests out with select retail employees. \
Correct. After the AR service reaches general availability (GA), the team can roll it out to production.

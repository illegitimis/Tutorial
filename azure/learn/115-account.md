Resources | Resources are instances of services that you create, like virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases.
Resource groups | Resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a _logical container_ into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
Subscriptions | A subscription groups together user accounts and the resources that have been created by those user accounts. For each subscription, there are _limits or quotas on the amount of resources_ that you can create and use. Organizations can use subscriptions to _manage costs_ and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects.
Management groups | These groups help you _manage access, policy, and compliance_ for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

You've been tasked with defining and implementing the governance strategy for Tailwind Traders.

Cloud governance requires good analysis and requirement gathering. \
Luckily, the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure can help you define and implement your governance strategy. \
There are several services and features in Azure to support these efforts:
- Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) enables you to create roles that define access permissions.
- Resource locks prevent resources from being accidentally deleted or changed.
- Resource tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources.
- Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources.
- Azure Blueprints enables you to define a repeatable set of governance tools and standard Azure resources that your organization requires.

With these points in mind, you're ready to take the next step toward building a good cloud governance strategy.

1. An attacker can bring down your website by sending a large volume of network traffic to your servers. \
Which Azure service can help Tailwind Traders protect its App Service instance from this kind of attack?
- [ ] Azure Firewall
- [ ] Network security groups
- [X] Azure DDoS Protection \
DDoS Protection helps protect your Azure resources from DDoS attacks. \
A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources, making the application slow or unresponsive to legitimate users.  

2. What's the best way for Tailwind Traders to **limit all outbound traffic** from VMs to known hosts?
- [ ] Configure Azure DDoS Protection to limit network access to trusted ports and hosts.
- [X] Create application rules in Azure Firewall. \
Azure Firewall enables you to limit outbound HTTP/S traffic to a specified list of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
- [ ] Ensure that all running applications communicate with only trusted ports and hosts.

3. How can Tailwind Traders most easily implement a deny by default policy so that VMs can't connect to each other?
- [ ] Allocate each VM on its own virtual network.
- [X] Create a network security group rule that prevents access from another VM on the same network. \
A network security group rule enables you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.
- [ ] Configure Azure DDoS Protection to limit network access within the virtual network.

# What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?

Deployment model | Description | comparison
---|---|---
Public cloud | Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet. | No capital expenditures to scale up. Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned. Organizations pay only for what they use.
Private cloud | A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. | Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance. Organizations have complete control over resources and security. Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.
Hybrid cloud | A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. | Provides the most flexibility. Organizations determine where to run their applications. Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements

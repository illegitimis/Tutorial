## App Service

`App Service` is an HTTP-based service that enables you to build and host many types of web-based solutions without managing infrastructure. For example, you can host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in several supported programming languages. Applications developed in .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python can run in and scale with ease on both Windows-based and Linux-based environments.

## Availability zones

- physically separate datacenters within an Azure region.
- Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.
- An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary.
- If one zone goes down, the other continues working.
- Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.

 [Azure Dedicated Host]() provides _dedicated_ physical servers to host your Azure VMs for Windows and Linux. Default hardware shared, workloads isolated. A dedicated host is mapped to a physical server in an Azure datacenter. A *host group* is a collection of dedicated hosts.

 ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure-fundamentals/protect-against-security-threats-azure/media/6-dedicated-hosts-cab8e670.png)

You're charged per dedicated host, independent of how many VMs you deploy to it [*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/protect-against-security-threats-azure/6-host-virtual-machines-dedicated-hosts).

## Resource group

- A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
- The resource group includes resources that you want to manage as a group.
- You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your organization.
- A resource group is a _logical container_ for resources deployed on Azure.
- These resources are anything you create in an Azure subscription like VMs, Azure Application Gateway instances, and Azure Cosmos DB instances.
- All resources must be in a resource group, and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group.
- Many resources can be moved between resource groups with some services having specific limitations or requirements to move.
- Resource groups _can't be nested_.
- Before any resource can be provisioned, you need a resource group for it to be placed in.
- If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within it are also deleted

- Azure takes care of managing the server infrastructure and the allocation and deallocation of resources based on demand.
- Infrastructure isn't your responsibility.
- Scaling and performance are handled automatically.
- You're billed only for the exact resources you use.
- There's no need to even reserve capacity.

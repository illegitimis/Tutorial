layer | name | desc
---|---|---
7 | application | end-user software,  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS)
6 | presentation | encode, encrypt, and compress data
5 | session | creates communication channels/session, controls ports
4 | transport | data transmission segments, flow and error control, TCP/UDP
3 | network | breaks up segments into network packets when sending and reassemble on receive, routing
2 | data link | data format over network, establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network.  It breaks up packets into **frames** and sends them from source to destination. This layer is composed of two partsâ€”Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network protocols, performs error checking and synchronizes frames, and Media Access Control (MAC) which uses MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive data.
1 | physical | physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes.
